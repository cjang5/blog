<p>Well I'm finally home for Thanksgiving! And for those already wondering, this is not a typical coding post. I need to talk about something I need to get off my chest. I can't really tell too many of my friends as they wouldn't understand my excitment. Or maybe they would, but I need to vent this SOMEWHERE regardless.</p>

<p>So anyway, there I am, sitting at my terminal waiting for my flight home to the East Coast for Thanksgiving Break. I'm just sitting there reading <i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i> to pass some time and the person across from me asks if I like the book. I express some positivity for the book as it was pretty in-depth and I was confident it would prepare me for any potential interviews. Intrigued by his interest in the book, I asked him if he programmed. He replied that he used to. Curious...So I asked him what he did now. And lo and behold, he turned out to be a Project Manager at one of the companies I dreamed of working at one day!</p>

<p> Baffled at the chances of me meeting someone like this just sitting waiting for my flight, I excitedly made conversation with him for some 15 or 20 minutes, talking about what he did, how he liked it, and what I wanted to do. When it was time for his flight, he handed me a business card and was off. For several minutes after that I was just still -- in shock. Still amazed at the sheer possibility of me meeting someone like that (maybe they're big, but I don't know, this has never happened to me before) I just sat there, in a pool of different emotions - excitement, wonder, anxiety, and hope. I always hear from people the stressed importance of networking and here was another person for me to network with!</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all I have. I just need to write that somewhere and get it off my chest. I'm going to email him and followup and thank him for his conversation. Pretty exciting! :)</p>
