<p> So my first "real" blog post. I've been assigned a new lab in CS class today, pertaining to the fabulous data structure, the B-Tree. I think the B-Tree is probably one of my favorite data structures that we've touched on so far. They're used (to my understanding) for storing large, large amounts of data in Hard Disk Drives and Solid State Drives. Each node in the tree is made up of an array of key/data pairs, and it's children the same. *And*, it's all sorted, of course. Pretty cool </p>

<p> So we were assigned with implementing 4 functions: insertion_idx, find, split_child, and insert. </p>
