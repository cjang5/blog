<p>Well, my first blog post. This is a strange concept for me, as I have never had a "blog" before. Not really sure how this works, as a result. I suppose I should start by introducing myself!</p>

<img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/post-01/1999-orchards.png" align="middle">

<p>That there (above) is me as a little (4 year old) baby. I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1995 and have since moved to a lot of places. I only lived there for 6 months or so, so I have virtually no memory of that state at all. My parents and I moved to Bethelehem, Pennsylvania after that for around 8 years. Then to Ellicott City, Maryland, and then finally to where we live today: Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Yeah, I move a lot. It sucks cause I've had to leave a lot of friends, but I'm sure we'll be staying in Fair Lawn for a while, so I'm fine with that.</p>

<p> By the way, if you want a more recent picture of me, feel free to click "Website" to be taken to my main website.</p>

<p> Anyways, I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I love music, programming, am crazy about aesthetics - which leads to my interest in front-end web development, and meeting people! I also have a YouTube channel focused on video game commentary over <a href="http://www.youtube.com/wtfridgerator" target="_blank">"here"</a>. I haven't uploaded in a year or two now due to university, but I still hold pride in it. It taught me how to really pour all your time and passion into something, and I learned the values of determination and hard work. It also taught me to be more outgoing and friendly by putting me on the spot in front of the Internet, and helped me to grow out of my introvertive shell. I won't soon forget the experience. </p>

<p> Well I feel this post is getting to be a bit long now, so I'll probably wrap it up. I hope to use this as an outlet to voice my thoughts on implementations of various projects I undertake, including MPs and such from my classes. I heard its good to voice the thought process so I thought "Hey, might as well". I probably won't have an active audience, but hey, who cares? But if you ARE someone other than me reading this, hello! And I hope you stay :)</p>

<p>Welp, see you soon!</p>
