<p>My first <a href="http://www.chrisjang.com/blog/2014/10/28/hello-world/">blog post</a> might be enough for an "About Me" but I'll make one here anyway.</p>

<p>My name is Christopher Jang, but I prefer to be called Chris. I am currently (as of writing) a sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I'm having a blast and learning so much every day here. I really appreciate my parents for sending me here, and I hope I can make it up to them by landing a great job when I graduate.</p>

<p>A little more about me. I was born in Minnesota, then moved to Pennsylvania, then Maryland, then FINALLY New Jersey. I am a second-generation Korean-American, and I am proud of that fact.</p>

<p> My hobbies include: listening to music, programming, creating aesthetically pleasing things, making friends, sleeping, getting super passionate about TV shows and movies. My favorite TV shows include Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Adventure Time, The Office, Skins UK. My favorite movie would probably have to be the Lord of the Rings franchise, and so so many more. I can't reasonably name them all here.</p>

<p>I hope to land a gig with a software company when I leave this school (or maybe even create my own startup. I'm still a sophomore, so I have time). I want to make it big in the world of technology and hopefully get enough of a foundation to start giving back. I'm really big on helping others, and I'd like to secure my parents' financial situation ASAP before ANYTHING ELSE. They deserve it. After that, I'd try to give back to all sorts of communities. </p>

<p>Well, that's all I can think of for now. Be sure to check out my website!</p>
